# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction
First off, Thank you very much for your contribution to this open-source project. The purpose of these guidelines is to help us communicate better and handle each contribution to the project carefully.

## Your First contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking at issues marked as `beginner-friendly` or `good-first-issue`; issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
When picking up an issue to solve, use the comments to propose the solution.
